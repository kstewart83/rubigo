# ============================================================================

# Network assets define physical network and computing infrastructure.
# Each asset tracks manufacturer, model, serial, and physical location.

# NOTES:
# - status: "storage" | "installed:active" | "installed:inactive"
# - category: Network | Server | Storage | Endpoint
# - Racked items use: rack, position_u (1=bottom), height_u
# - Unracked items use: space, storage_location (free text)

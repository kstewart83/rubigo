# NOTES:
# 1. Floor Numbering: Floors are zero-indexed conceptually but floor 0 is skipped.
#    - Negative numbers are basement/underground levels.
#    - Level 1 is the first above-ground floor.
# 2. Floor Ranges: Defined as { min = <int>, max = <int> } (inclusive).
#    - Example: { min = -1, max = 3 } includes floors -1, 1, 2, 3 (skipping 0).
# 3. Floor Names: 'floor_names' array corresponds exactly to the valid floors in the range.
